## 1. Purpose of This Declaration
This document formally affirms the authorship, originality, and independent creation of the software, database schema, architecture, documentation, and written materials associated with this repository and the broader Foreside Holdings development framework.  

It is provided to protect the creator against claims of unauthorized copying, derivative works, or improper AI replication, and to serve as a formal record of ownership, creative intent, and design authorship.

## 2. Statement of Independent Creation

I, **Daniel J. LeBlanc**, declare that:

1. All source code, database schemas, architectural designs, documentation, diagrams, developer notes, and written materials contained in this repository were **conceptualized, structured, and authored by me** as part of my Foreside Holdings product suite.

2. All technical design decisions—including software architecture, multi-tenant organization model, POS workflow logic, accounting schema, naming conventions, data-layer rules, developer workflow methods, and KDP publishing framework—were independently determined and intentionally structured as original work.

3. No code, text, diagrams, or proprietary materials were copied from any copyrighted source.  
   The system follows **industry-standard software patterns**, which:
   - are functional necessities,
   - are not proprietary to any company,
   - cannot be copyrighted under U.S. law and international norms,
   - and are common best practices for backend systems.

4. Any assistance from AI systems (including ChatGPT) was used exclusively for:
   - editing,
   - debugging,
   - architectural review,
   - design discussion,
   - and refinement of code I originated.

   AI involvement is **editorial and consultative**, not generative of third-party proprietary content.  
   The final system is my own intellectual creation.

## 3. Copyright Ownership

All original work in this repository is the exclusive intellectual property of:

**Foreside Holdings, LLC**  
All rights reserved.

This includes, without limitation:

- Software source code  
- Database models and schema  
- Documentation and developer guides  
- Framework chapters, essays, appendices, and KDP manuscripts  
- SystemHub architecture  
- ArcoirisPOS / NanoPOS designs  
- Custom naming conventions  
- Organizational models  
- Workbook integration methods  
- Code transfer and encoding hygiene rules  
- Proprietary developer workflow protocols  

Licensing terms (commercial, open, or hybrid) may be added or modified later by Foreside Holdings.

---

## 4. Clean-Room Development Affirmation

The work was developed through an **independent, clean-room process**, meaning:

- No proprietary source code, data, or confidential materials owned by competitors or third-party products were referenced, reused, replicated, or derived.
- All structures arise from first principles, domain expertise, public knowledge of accounting/POS conventions, and my own engineering judgment.

Where industry-standard concepts appear similar to other systems, this is a consequence of universal design patterns, not duplication.

---

## 5. Traceability and Version Control

This repository reflects a full authorship trail, including:

- Incremental commits  
- Version history  
- Architectural notes  
- KDP framework drafts  
- Debugging sessions  
- SystemHub Beta development checkpoints  
- Workbook integration designs  
- Personal writing style and unique naming structure  

These provide strong, time-stamped evidence of independent authorship.

## 6. Future Integration

This declaration applies to:

- ArcoirisPOS backend  
- NanoPOS  
- Nano Business Suite  
- Foreside Framework Developer Handbook  
- Developer Workflow and Hygiene Standards  
- KDP manuscripts and appendices (E through I and beyond)  
- SystemHub Documentation
